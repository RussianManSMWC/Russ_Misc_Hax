My miscallenious game ASM hacks.

Flips is used to apply .bps and .ips patches to a clean, unmodified ROM of any game (link: https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=11474).

Asar is used to apply .asm patches to the SNES game ROMs such as Tecmo Secret of the Stars (https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar).

A special version of xkas is used to apply .asm patches to the NES game ROMs such as Super Mario World (NES). Unfortunately, this fork's repository appears to be lost, so I can't link it. All I know is that it was made by Raidenthequick. I included the .exe in this repository.
