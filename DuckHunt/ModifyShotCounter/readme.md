# Duck Hunt - Shot Counter Hack
Modifies the shot counter to make it use a number, allowing for a shot amount higher than 3.

Originally showcased at Winter C3 2020 at SMW Central, and apparently I didn't even release it? It wasn't even complete, as it didn't modify clay shooting. I finally updated and released its code.
